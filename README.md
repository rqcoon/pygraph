# pygraph
some neat little programs I made for an assignment

# main
main is the first part. It takes values from xdata and ydata and spits out a graph with 2 fitted curves, showing the equation for one of them. You can change the data by either changing the array for xdata or ydata. Keep in mind that if you change xdata to have the array, you will have to change ydata to np.arange(len(xdata))

# test4
test4 is the second part, it has the original data input through the same method as main, except test4 has sliders and a set equation. I adjust the sliders to fit the original data the best, but you will have to change minimum and maximum values if you change the dataset.
